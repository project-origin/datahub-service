  /measurements:
    post:
      summary: Get a list of Measurements
      description: >
        Returns a list of Measurement objects which belongs to any of the
        user's MeteringPoints with options to filter/narrow down the results.
        Can only select MeteringPoints which belongs to the user.
            
        ## Offset and limit (paging)
        
        The client can optionally provide an "offset" and/or "limit" of how many objects to
        return in each request. The response JSON contains the total amount
        of results (independent of the provided offset and limit), and can
        be used to calculate total number of requests required to get all Measurements.
        Its adviced to keep the provided "limit" reasonable low, as JSON encoding-
        and decoding can be rather memory consuming.
        
        ## Filtering
        
        The "filters" object in the request body allows to narrow down results.
        All filters are optional, but can be mixed to perform complex searches.
        Some filters are an arrays of values, which filters out any Measurements not matching
        any of the provided values (analogous to an SQL "IN" statement).
        
        ### Filtering on Measurement begin
        
        "begin" is the time at which the measurement began. It usually have an
        end time which is one hour later, but only the begin is filtered upon.
        It is possible to filters Measurements on either one specific begin, or a
        range/period defined by a from- and to datetime.
        These two options should be considered mutually exclusive.

  /measurements/summary:
    post:
      summary: Get a summary of Measurements
      description: >
        Returns a summary of the user's Measurements, or a subset hereof.
        Useful for plotting or visualizing data, or wherever aggregated
        data is needed.
        
        ## Filtering
        
        Measurements are filtered in the same way as with the /measurements endpoint (above).
        
        ## Time resolution
        
        Data is returned in the date/time resolution specified in the request. The total amount of energy (Wh) is aggregated/summarized for each period. Available resolutions are:
        
        - all
        
        - year
        
        - month
        
        - day
        
        - hour
        
        ## Labels
        
        The response contans an array of labels in order. Each label is a string representing a period of time according to the requested time resolution. There may be gaps in the array, depending on the source data (unless the "fill" parameter in the request is set to true).
        
        ## Grouping
        
        Data can be grouped by multiple different keys, much like an SQL "GROUP BY" statement.
        The returned data is split into one or more groups. Each group has an array of values, which is the aggregated energy for a period of time. The values are in same order as the returned labels. Values may be null.
